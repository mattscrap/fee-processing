            <h2>How We Calculate Totals</h2>
            <p>
                The total amount after fees is calculated by subtracting the calculated fees (transaction fee plus fixed fee) 
                from the original sale amount. This provides the actual amount you'll receive after accounting for payment 
                processing fees.
